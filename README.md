## Fabulous Flashcards (Java)
This program performs similar functions to other applications/websites like Quizlet. Here are its funcationalities:
- The user can enter/add data, modify data, and delete cards from the array
- The user can sort the cards by term/category or randomize them and display all of the cards in the current array (in their current order).
- The user can test themselves on their definitions however this can only be done one way: by typing in the corresponding term (not the definition). The correct terms and incorrect terms can then be reloaded, so that the user can target certain terms (e.g. test only the ones they failed) in particular.
- The user can save their cards at any time, so they can access the same cards later.
- The user can load cards from the saved card file, the master cards or the failed cards, giving them the ability to choose exactly what terms they would like to practice.
